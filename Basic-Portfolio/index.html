      <p>
        I was born on May 8, 1991. I grew up in central Jersey near the beach area with my parents and three older brothers. After high school, I graduated from Brookdale Community college and then transferred to Rutgers University a year and a half later. I received my bachelors in Exercise Kinesiology in 2014 then started working for Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. In my spare time I play in a couple soccer leagues and attend bible study with some friends from church.

        I come from a family of six. My parents were both born in Bolivia and got married at the age of nineteen but are now divorced and both remarried. They had two boys before they moved to the states, Sergio Jr. and Diego. After a few years, they settled in West Long Branch, New Jersey and later had two more children, Nathaniel and myself.
